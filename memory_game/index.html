<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-sujaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards</p>

<h3>Why Concentration?</h3>
<p>Concentration is a classic brain teaser! The brain is a muscle that needs to be exercised just like the rest of the body, so why not make getting the brain in shape fun?</p>
